        <b>Q: What should I do if my student does not want to learn what I am teaching?</b><br>
        <p>A: Change the topic! It's okay if you don't have a backup plan. You can ask your student what they would like to learn instead, or tell them to give you some time as you search for a new topic to teach. Be flexible!</p>

        <b>Q: Do I need to be fluent in Chinese to teach well?</b><br>
        <p>A: No! You can keep a translator open if you aren't fluent enough to explain phrases on your own. Just helping your student learn how to pronounce English words they may be struggling with is also a big help already.</p>
